"Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American 🚙"," Oct 08, 2019 ",By Karan Khanna,4.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/good-suv-but-engine-makes-lot-of-noises-89194.htm
"It's a great car. I have a Jeep Compass 2018 is a limited manual car. It was my dream to own. Till date, I haven't faced any problem. The power, handling, luxury feel, everything you get it for 20-25 lakhs is absolutely insane. More than that it's really suited to Indian road conditions. I never felt lethargic even after driving for 600+ km per day."," Dec 02, 2019 ",By Raj,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/excellent-car-95330.htm
"Jeep Compass is the most efficient car, elegantly designed, and most powerful car in this segment, compared to Harrier, Creta this is the most efficient and it's the best value for money. Excellent driving experience with all the necessary features required in this segment of car. If any confusion with similar cars, just go and get jeep compass blindly and buy. Its limited plus version it's the best value for money."," Sep 22, 2019 ",By Sougata Sen,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/excellent-suv-86261.htm
"Value for money.
Its been nearly 2 years of my Jeep Compass limited edition and I must say, it's just a completely fantastic car. The features are very good. Loved this car and its value for money. Maintenance is a bit high but the person who buys 5 seaters in this range does not feel it so.

"Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all-round performance. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking."," Jul 14, 2019 ",By Vineet Sharma,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/the-most-complete-suv-72243.htm

"The buying experience wasn't as expected. The car, however, was a different story. It has the looks which draw passerby's attention, very fun to drive due to the amount of power and torque available on hand. The build quality is commendable (both exterior and interior), far better than cars in the same segment. The numerous small features give a good feel. It gives around 12kmpl for daily city driving which is acceptable. The after sales service is a bit on the higher side and they don't provide free pick up and drop for the same, which all manufacturers do.

"My name is Johnson Correya and I currently reside in Powai (Mumbai). I have purchased a petrol model Jeep Compass Sports Variant with Manual Transmission. Before buying the vehicle, I had checked reviews on different websites about this vehicle and discussed the features with the sales team, especially with the salesperson from the Landmark Mumbai showroom (Abhishek). All automobile related sites and the salesman had claimed that the mileage for this model is 14-17 km/liter. I don't have any other problems with this model except the mileage for which I am getting an average of 5 to 5.5 km/liter with a mixture of conditions like traffic, without traffic and high way etc. I approached the CRM Mr. Salim who asked me to bring the car for a check-up. I dropped the vehicle off on 14/11/18 after completing 1200 km. I had reset the meter just before I dropped the vehicle at the service center. Service adviser Prateek attended my vehicle and suggested me to come back after 3 days as they wanted to test the entire vehicle. I complied and collected the vehicle after 3 days had elapsed. While I was collecting the vehicle, he informed me that they had checked the vehicle in traffic conditions and they had gotten 10 km/liter with no other technical issues in the vehicle. They have written the average mileage as 10 km/liter in the service form. I checked the mileage meter just after leaving the service center then I realized that the mileage was 4.5km/liter and they have driven the vehicle 14.5 km. It was a barefaced lie which they told me that they got 10 km/liter in traffic conditions. I had informed the mileage issue to the CRM (Salim) again. He had suggested that he would send one person with me to check my driving pattern. He had sent Aditya Dhere on 23.11.18 at 6 pm at my office. He accompanied me for 2 km in traffic conditions. He understood that the issue is with the mileage and not with my driving patterns. He had taken a picture of the mileage meter and sent it to the CRM. We got 2.2 km/liter for around 2 km drive with 25 minutes of travel. I don't travel always in traffic, 5-5.5 is an average of a mix (all conditions). It is not worth driving this vehicle with the kind of average I get and why the company is offering an impossible mileage of 14-17 km/liter is ludicrous and preposterous. They haven't given any solution till date. My humble request to the customers, please do not buy Jeep compass as they are selling the car with fake commitments."," Jan 17, 2019 ",By Johnson,1.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/petrol-driking-mechine-avrage-56kml-27871.htm

"We are a family of four and we all are really fond of cars including my little one 2 years old as well. The elder 10 year old son can rattle the power and torque figures of different cars. Most of the cars we have owned are driving oriented and we always take the build quality, driving dynamics and safety as top priorities every time we choose a new car. Just to name the cars in our fleet in the past, we owned Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Skoda Yeti and Laura. All these cars gave brilliant experience with well sorted performance. But choosing the Yeti successor was quite a difficult task as the list of priorities increased all these years. We shortlisted the priorities which included nice driving dynamics, strong build quality and safety, leather steering wheel, leather seats, silent/powerful diesel engine, spaciousness, distinct styling and of course, the hill hold control since I have phobia of rolling back. So, fortunately we were able to shortlist the cars and the list included Renault Duster, Audi Q3, BMW X1, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Tiguan and Jeep Compass. The Audi and BMW were rejected due to fact that our regular drives to the outskirts where my grandparents live would prove a nightmare for these cars. Skoda Kodiaq and VW Tiguan were outrageously priced for what they offer while we listed out Renault Duster because it lacks adequate safety features. So, the last option remained in the list which was meeting all our expectations was Jeep Compass. Now coming to the initial experience, man, it's a head turner. Wherever I take my blazing red Jeep Compass, it really grabs eyeballs. It has pretty striking similarity with the Range Rover Evoque, especially the blackened roof. My wife is really smitten with this car, during the early drive of 40 kms, we drove equally for 30 kilometers. The car is exceptionally comfortable to drive with the engine barely audible from inside even if you cruise at the speed of 80kmph. The 2.0L engine produces 173PS and 350Nm of peak torque with the SUV giving above 16kmpl mileage in mix conditions which is pretty much acceptable given the stature of the car. With linear acceleration, the vehicle can reach the 80-90kmph mark in no time. The engine is quite smooth and does not have turbo lag unlike other cars we owned in the past. Coming to the part which I liked the most is the robust quality this car comes with. It is heavy especially the doors, hood and the tailgate. The car comes with all the safety aspects which we needed including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill start assist, electronic parking brake and ISOFIX rear child seat mounts. The braking is adequate and it comes to halt in the straight line without any fuss. In terms of comfort inside, the car is an absolute bliss with enough legroom at the rear which most people complain about in the car. The car has all the contemporary gizmos including the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto support and a very effective air conditioner. However, the sound output from the AV system was mediocre although one can always add extra speakers to increase the decibels. Driven over 3000kms so far and it has been a wonderful experience with this car. Anyone who wants a little show-off with utter cabin comfort, safety and smooth engine performance, I think Jeep Compass can be a good choice under Rs. 25 lakhs."," Nov 19, 2018 ",By Shailendra,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-my-experience-after-driving-3000kms-21737.htm

They are committed for after sales service but they may have a practical issue with on -road service or stock issue as they are rising and not completely established.

"I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied. Till now I have driven around 3350 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour. I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams. As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good. Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly. I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car.

"My friend recently bought the Jeep Compass and we got out for a small drive. As we drove down the highways, the car felt well planted and I didn?t have to switch gears very frequently in order to keep the car moving, which made it pretty relaxing to drive. But when we came back in the city, the heavy clutch started to get irritating and painful. The infotainment system offered with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will not disappoint you but it would have been better if it had a large screen in place. I quite liked the car and I would like to get one myself but the unavailability of an automatic transmission is a deal breaker for me.

"As and when Compass comes with AT 4x4 it will cost atleast 23.5 and obviously as it is a new launch there are no discount offers. Tucson with discount offers between 1-1.5 L is going to be available for almost the same price as the AT 4x4 Compass. Therefore a Tucson which is bigger, more powerful, more fuel efficient, better dynamically designed, more reliable, better ASS network, better looking ( depends on ones own taste), drives more like a sedan ( most of ones driving is going to be on metalled roads), needs serious considerations.As far as brand value (snob value ) is concerned worldwide Hyundai sells more Tucson than Jeep selling compass and has better ratings.In fact Jeep products are at the bottom of the rung. Now the present compass may be a new vehicle and may behave differently but it is still untested. A short test drive is not enough to test a vehicle which is going to cost more than 25 L.

"Good to be back again?this time I am writing a review for the Jeep Compass Longitude Diesel MT. This is the mid segment jeep in the compass series. To start with let me tell you the vehicle is absolutely ?SOLID? heavy build and gives you an impeccable presence wherever you go. So lets talk engine dynamics, the diesel engine of this baby is a 2 Ltr Multijet diesel engine meshed with a 6 speed gear box yielding 173 PS power which is sufficient to propel this vehicle really fast. The acceleration is good but the pickup still might need some work. It can be blamed on the heavy build of the vehicle as the engine after all is 2 ltr. The breaking is pretty efficient as I did try the odd ball 60 KM/HR to ?0? breaking and the vehicle responded perfectly telling me that the ABS and EBD systems gelled perfectly. Let?s talk driving comfort now, although the gear shifts are smooth but the clutch does require some pushing and in city driving you might get a bit of a foot ache if you are not used to it. The vehicle can power down if you are at a low speed trying to drive at a higher gear. One thing I really loved was the electronic parking brake which replaced a hand brake with a nifty little button where the hand brake used to exist. Now coming to the ergonomics on this vehicle, the instrument cluster is well lit and the infotainment system has just the right features. I bought the Longitude and not the optional so features like car play and android auto were not available. They did provide a usb port in the rear which was pretty good. There were a couple of things which did disappoint like there was no climatronic AC, although the door handled has leathered upholstery the seats were fabric which was very disappointing and the Jeep accessory for the seat costed about 16000 MRP. The car has reverse parking sensors but no camera which is not one would expect after paying a good amount for this car and lets face it, it doesn?t cost much. Another things which was painful was that the car?s speaker system was absolutely flat no zing to it. The car does have traction control but not sure how much of that you would use. In summary the car is excellent in terms of handling and well grounded, the features are there but for the price I paid I expected much more. Overall, if you would really like a Jeep with all the bells and whistled go for a Longitude Optional or Limited. Happy and safe driving."," Dec 27, 2017 ",By Samriddh Mangotra,4.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-a-great-value-for-money-suv-18826.htm
"Was looking to move on from my good old Mitsubishi Outlander - Yes a petrol suv :). Not a Diesel fan. Criteria was : An SUV, Chic Looks, Automatic Petrol. not much choices available in Indian market.
Shortlisted between :
Fortuner Petrol & Tucson Petrol . Then read some where jeep is launching Petrol with automatic .. so thought should give it a try & thank heavens I did that..!
Result : Booked the Car same day - a Sunday & guess what got delivery on Thursday same week .. wow :) what an experience.. Have drive 300 KM till now, and from my place of work to people on road, to my society, people just can't stop talking about the way it looks .. RED beast with black top..! At 22 Lacs -- super engine, upmarket interior and a fabulous planted ride both in city and highway.. you can't ask more .. plus for us Indians - chance to own a JEEP -- not a fake JEEP but original JEEP.. If anyone is thinking of buying it -- don't think twice .. just go for it.. you won't regret a second of owning it!! With govt regulations being stricter on diesel cars/suv.. this JEEP petrol automatic is the best available SUV over 20 LACs you can buy.. as far as 4*4 how of us.. had or will actually use it in future? Its just a badge for which you pay more and hardly use!"," Nov 21, 2017 ",By Tkt Verified Buyer,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/truly-an-urban-jeep-18665.htm
"In India jeep cars and not supplying very good tyres with the car because in my Jeep Compass car FIRESTONE tyre got BURSTED (only mysore city ride) for 1350KM!
BE AWARE OF IT!!!"," Dec 26, 2017 ",By Abhishek Kumar,2.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/worst-tyres-in-jeep-cars-18822.htm
"I bought the Jeep Compass just for its head-turning looks. But to my amazement, the Compass has a lot more to offer. The ride quality is sublime and so is the seating comfort. Although the high door sills do get in the way at times, especially when you are in a hurry. The sound system is amazing but I can't say the same for the infotainment display. Yes, it has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility but there's a noticeable lag in its operation. I have bought the 2.0-litre Limited variant without the 4x4 system. Up until now, I am more than satisfied with the Compass. But as I mentioned above, there are some drawbacks. But then that's the case with all cars I believe. To finish it off, I would just like to add that if you want something different and capable at the same time, the Jeep Compass will not disappoint you."," Oct 12, 2017 ",By Sumita Kapoor,4.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/the-compass-is-here-to-stay-18551.htm
"Multiple Issues
Bad experience so far...Gear issues accompanied by burning smell. Electronic Parking Brake failure ! All in less than 2000 km !. Even the service team is clueless."," Dec 07, 2017 ",By Srinivasa Rao,1.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/multiple-issues-18758.htm
"First 3 version of Jeep Compass are not worth the money - but things change when you look at Limited option & onwards. You get all the features one would like to see in a compact SUV - Price is bit higher compared to other brands but brand also matters so i'm sure people will go for Compass & will not look at the price.
Buy it for Brand, Quality, performance and style."," Oct 17, 2017 ",By Ishrat Aziz,4.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/brand-quality-style-18563.htm
"I have been a huge fan of Jeep badge. The sturdy and macho vehicles that this American brand manufactures are simply unmatchable. I have been following the Jeep Compass since the time it was first showcased. The massive road presence and the sharp styling of the Compass SUV cannot be compared to any other crossover in the country. Apart from this, its tyres will get your heart racing, they are just fantastic.The crossover is fully loaded but the biggest surprise came in the form of the price. Just Rs 14.95 lakh! I am amazed with Jeep's pricing strategy, it undercuts almost all its rivals and is definitely here to rule the Indian automotive arena. The other plus points of the Compass is the availability in both the petrol and diesel engines. Another important bit of the Jeep SUV is the Jeep Active Drive 4x4 system which disconnects rear axle and effortlessly keeps on switching between 4x2 and 4x4 drive types to ensure one gets the 4x4 capability only when it's essential, thus saving the extra effort of the vehicle. I am sure it must be helping out on the fuel efficiency numbers as well. With the Compass, a new beast of performance is here. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will be watching how the sales of the Compass take off. However, the more critical aspect is how Jeep is able to tackle the after-sales service of the Compass in a country obsessed with 'cheap and best' philosophy."," Jul 31, 2017 ",By Micheal Verified Buyer,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-unbelievably-affordable-18366.htm
"After months of waiting fr it's launch, I booked the top-end 4x4 on the first day the bookings opened.
I am now going to cancel my booking. Reasons:
1. No delivery of 4x4 till Nov.
2. Imminent increase in taxes, & the On-Road Price will go frm 24 to 26 Lacs
3. Pay 26L fr a top-end vehicle, and you still have dummy buttons on the steering, undersized LCD with an odd plastic frame to cover the gap, & most importantly, NO SUN ROOF
4. 70000 diff between Limited & (O), All you get is a Black Roof & HIDJeep is making vehicles with Sun Roof, even the Trailhawk in Pune, but only for export. I can live without the Auto Wipers / Headlights / Cruise Control, but no Sunroof on a 26 Lac (mid-size) car.. doesn't work for me.
While the entry level Compass is priced right, the top-end is overpriced, considering Jeep is palming off an incomplete product to Indian customers."," Aug 23, 2017 ",By S Singh Verified Buyer,3.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/no-4x4-till-november-no-sunroof-18413.htm
"I saw the Jeep Compass at a nearby dealership today. It is smaller than what it looks in the images. The Tucson, in comparison, looks wider. Sit inside and the quality of the materials used is good. The space is also decent and two six-feet tall guys can sit one behind the other. But it doesn't look as wide as you think it will be. From the driver's seat, it feels as if you're sitting in a vehicle of Creta's size. After sitting in the Compressed, sorry Compass, I felt that the starting price of around Rs 15 lakh is fair, and not very aggressive. Also, considering the reliability issues with the brand in most other markets, even if you are saving some money upfront, it'll be used up on the SUV only, and may not count as savings. There were a lot of people out there to check the Compass in the dealership and it looks like it will sell in good numbers. But I think I'll wait to see how Jeep fares in the after-sales department. I'm not sure if they'll be able to manage it."," Aug 01, 2017 ",By Arun,2.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/small-suv-18369.htm
