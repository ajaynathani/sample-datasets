"Exterior Really great and looks good compared to SUV's in the same league.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Quality of interior is good . However it is higly disappointing that Jeep has not provided reverse camera which is an essential requirement even in its longitude (O) variant.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I bought my Jeep compass(Diesel, 4X2) two months back and within few days of purchase, I have observed a high level of rattling sound from the engine. Sound was so irritating and often happens while accelerating at 2nd and 3rd gears and sound vanishes when accelerate further and  gets past 2000. Finally, I have observed that engine making rattling only when it is  starts from cold start condition and it persists nearly one hour. To my great greatest surprise, it was found that rattling noise vanishes when the engine stop and start again. I have demonstrated the problem to the dealer and they are now taking up the matter with manufacturer. I am looking forward for the action from Jeep.
Ride Quality & Handling Good.
Final Words Being an iconic brand, Jeep shoud have done more R&D on engine to avoid the issues with the engine sound.
Areas of improvement Additional features like reverse camera and larger infotainment screen.

"I am using this car. Performance of the car is great. It’s around 7000 Kms driven. In 5000 Kms itself, i getting a disruptive noise in doors. And few more looser parts inside. It’s total disappointment. Now Continuously the noise is there while the driving. Even service providers couldn’t solve. At last they accepted that it’s vehicle complaint. And they created few more problems in door. Now the door is not close properly. I bought this vehicle with more interest and eager. But now I feel bad about it.",04-Jan-18,Arun,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/49924/
"I purchased this rugged machine on November 6th 2017,I was waiting this car since last year before I had xuv 500 which is quiet difficult in handling and over noisy at higher speed but JEEP COMPASS is excellent car I had done no mistake ??,always I wanted to drive powerful car so wanted to buy Audi q3 but it's very much expensive so final compass filled my dream this car is excellent power,performance,looks and built quality totally Iam very much happy..I'll suggest all if anyone wants to buy mid SUV blindly you can go for JEEP COMPASS??",12-Nov-17,Ranganath,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/49420/
"I bought a Jeep Compass on 28/1/2018 and yesterday on 04/02/2018 my car got broke down on the highway some where around 200 km away from my home. i don't know how a new car started vibrating and it was making noise, it was so humiliating and embarrassing for me  because i was with my family and relatives on a holiday trip and then this happened to me,  my cousins were making jokes and laughing on the car (On ME), the company dealer is saying that they have identified the problem and resolved it but i am so pissed off with the car that i don't want it back, so either you buy back the car and give me my money back or either give me a new piece because if the product is doing this within 7 days of purchase than I am sorry but I don't have any future expectations with this.    so just looking into this matter and resolve my issue because i don't expected this sort of CHEAP performance from a company like JEEP   samarth jain meerut

"We brought a jeep compass about 20 days back.  On receiving the vehicle, there was a constant clatter from the front pair of doors or panels.  On reporting this, they took the vehicle to the workshop promptly, reporting post return, the issue has been resolved.  In turn, while one door, the noise had dampened, though not eradicated, on the other door, the sound had increased.  Now I have to myself try multiple maneuvres to try and reduce the noise.  The staff were helpful in the showroom but frankly, they are sales people and they could hardly make out the real issue.  Now I am still awaiting a call from their Pune office to correct the issue and mind you, this is only 28 days post buying the vehicle.
All in all, at this price, it is a huge huge disappointment.  FCA/Mopar - you really need to take care of your standards.
Worst experience!!!
The drive experienceQuality checks are an issue",17-Jul-18,Anindya,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/56609/
The first long drive was disappointing. The Electronic Parking Brake failed after the first 150 km of my first long drive. And 20 km later the gear shift fails accompanied with strong rubber burning smell. 15 minutes later the car runs fine. The issues repeat during the return drive. Six days in the service centre - they are struggling to fix the issue.,09-Dec-17,Srinivasa,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/49698/
It is some costly but fair and smoth body easy space good design good mileage this is extremely charming and useful for rural areas also this is first car which give us completely different satisfaction due to a little quality explanation space I will end my thoughts compass is our time whenever we tiered hapless saddy we will go a long drive.,15-Aug-17,Gopal,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/48421/
"Exterior Head turner, stunning looks, Strongly built, very heavy as well. Front Grill with Jeep Brand stands out. started loving bad roads now (bangalore). Great presense on the road.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good features. Comfortable at all positions, strong AC and good music system. Enough space for boh rows. storage is very good
Loved carplay, button hand break, and multiple usb ports, dual AC temperatures, even the horn and lights.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth gear box, very good engine and decent fuel economy.
Ride Quality & Handling Amazing riding experience, you wont feel any bad road now, real SUV feel. very steady at high speeds. cruises on highway. Overtakes 0-100 in few seconds
Final Words Best buy if you want a premium SUV. its truely premium feel inside and outside. enough of mahindra copying jeep all their life.
Great car for every road and SAFEST for your family than the japanese cars
Areas of improvement Add sun roof, Automatic (in diesel), auto closing of windows/side mirrors.
Super Power/ Torque, Strongly built/safe, Amazing looksnothing",15-Nov-17,Ravi,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/49452/
"I am facing the death wobble issue in my NEW Jeep compass, I was near to hump and applied break and the car started shaking violently. This is a terrible issue and can cause accidents. 
I have talked to the dealer and they are not aware of this issue. They told they will look into this issue and rectify it. But I feel the technician who knows the problem can only fix it. Jeep should recall all cars and fix it. 
When you google you will find their are more jeep owners faced this problem and it persists from last 10+ years, how jeep is selling thier cars in India without fixing the problem. Time to think that you will see so many motivated videos regarding Jeep compass great personalities whom you can trust.
Style built qualityThey should have rectified this issue",19-Apr-18,Sant,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/55853/
"Before I start the detailed review, let me express a concern over the genuinity of the reviews posted by people who don't own the vehicle. For those who go by cumulative rating, 3.5 stars seems way too less. But the fact is that some of the disgruntled users who had issues with dealerships had a major hand in the same.
When Jeep Compass released in India, it was crearly 1 segment above my reach from my 2011 Toyota Etios G Petrol. I had hardly driven 40K in 7 years and was absolutely in love with driving comfort of my vehicle. I had to go for a segment upgrade and was searching for a 7 seater and then Jeep happened.
The thought of owning a premium truly international SUV at that price tag, made me jump one segment higher and even moved me away from 7 seater segment. I got the vehicle booked under my employer's lease plan - but changed the booking in my name at the last moment due to some reason. Result, I had no waiting that seems to be the biggest concern here.
I got the vehicle delivered on Jan 7th 2018 - Minimal Grey (I had the roof painted black for 20 K from showroom, which I feel is worth every paisa).
Exterior The Black roof gave the machine a range roversque look and I was the first in my firm to own one. To put it briefly, it made me famous - very famous. Everyone knew the guy who had the Jeep. The build quality was evident when I had an accident where the left front wheel arch and left side view mirror went under a National Permit Lorry while attempting a risky overtaking maneuver. Had it been any other vehicle, the left side view mirror would have shattered. Here, it simply folded and resumed all relectronic functionality once retracted. The wheel arch suffered a minor dent, which was fixed off-show room for a nominal expense.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Features:
All safety features that Jeep offers are premium and have experienced the traction control, ECS,HSA and ABS in real time. Fortunately there was no need for Air-bag deployment. Worth the money! The Uconnect entertainment system easily paired Apple phones via Apple Car Play butyou can have multiple devices paired, including Android. There are two USB charging points one in the front and one in the rear. Air Conditioning is efficient with both front and rear vents. Once paired, you can use SIRI or accept calls from steering controls. You can change the songs or skip FMs from steering controls. The volume control is also provided below steering. Handbrake is electronic, which requires minimal effort.Sound system with 6 speaker and all weather subwoofer in middle of dashboard is pure bliss. Side-view mirror vissibility can be electonically adjusted. Wipers are efficient.
Space & Comfort:
Having not used an SUV before and comparing Toyota's etios, which is several segments below Jeep, I can confidently say that a sedan is a sedan and no SUV can match the comfort it offers. But again, one should not compare apples to oranges.  The biggest disappontment was that Jeep could not make it a comfortable 5 seater at the least. Rear middle passenger is really cramped (This with every passenger falling below 60 KG) and not suitable for long drives. The rear vissibility is also poor from rear view mirror when 3rd passenger occupies the seat. Boot Space is OKyish - If the boot fills up, rear view mirror vissibility is again impacted.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine Performance:
This is where Jeep blew me away, FCA's 2.0 diesel engine is too good to be true. I had driven my etios for 40 K kms in 7 years. I have almost completed 10 K in my compass in under 3 months. It is a driver's dream. Driving comfort is unparallaled. 
Fuel Economy:
I followed the instructions from showroom of not exceeding 130 KM/H speed before 2000 KMs and got a mileage of close to 20 km/l in my first long trip to Munnar from Bangalore via Salem. There was minimal gear shifting required and I drove at constant 100 km/h speed. But it significantly drops with constant gear shifts and raising the vehicle suddenly.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is good, when it is used as a four seater. As per my family, it does not match the comfort of our etios. Handling is amazing.
Final Words This one is a head turner. Like old Onida Ad, world's envy, owner's pride. If only FCA could do something to increase the comfort of rear passengers, it would be really hard to beat Jeep in the segment.
Areas of improvement Ride comfort and rear seat. Boot Space. Rear view mirror vissibility.
Great Style and decent fuel economyRear seats are cramped - Strictly a four seater if using for long trips",19-Apr-18,Akshay,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/55855/
"I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales person.
I first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn't have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer.
I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer.
I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint. ""I cant say prices will increase etc..."" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off.
The product is very good, but this is not the end. But arrogant people like this waiting to  I have to go to these kind of people for service for the rest of the vehicles life. It is very difficult to do that after today's experince. When they can renege on their word today, they will do it every day
Hence I have glad that I did not sink my money into this unwelcome pit.

"My favorite and dream car it's smooth driving and high speed engine colors very very love it..... My The 2018 Compass is available in four trim levels: Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk. All come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (180 horsepower, 175 pound-feet of torque). A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the Sport, and a six-speed (FWD) or a nine-speed (AWD) automatic transmission is optional. All other Compass trims have the automatic as standard equipment. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is option",02-Nov-18,Aathi,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/59986/
"A CAR NOT TO BUY This car's turbo sets in around 2500 rpm. Till it reaches this rpm the car hardly moves, then suddenly it flies off the handle. This is impossible to control under most circumstances. In my opinion it is an accident waiting to happen. When i bring this up with the service station they just shrug it off as normal in all Jeep cars. It has pathetic fuel efficiency. Be that as it may the engine capacity is so small that the car needs refueling constantly. I cannot go from Bangalore to Mysore and back without refueling. I discovered this pretty early after buying the car. I decided to sell if even before i reached 1000 kms and one month after i purchased the car. When i inquired the purchase price, i was not even getting a quote for 17 lakhs. I paid 24.66 lakhs for the car. Though most cars lose their value once you drive out of the showroom, the Jeep's resale demand is non existent. In my opinion these cars should be banned from sale in India",06-Jun-19,Pradeep,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/93788/
No customer service.buying this car in December 2017. front headlight not working properly then I go to jeep service center..service manager told me without check my car sir car is absolutely fine. Pathetic experience,05-Feb-19,Sunny,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/76384/
"It is good in or better in interior and facilities and bad in pick up,avg and service ,worst in avg claiming 15km and giving 7 km Response zero from company, I bought from Surat and in bought as useful car as automatic but facing difficulty in city also ,all other way good and no doubt about safety and interior ,workmanship good ,but expecting whatever company claiming should we get at least 90% Hope company will contact and resolve issue",21-Sep-18,Atul,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/57440/
"Exterior Its good, but could have done better in paint department. Its good they cut in acessaries but they could have provided as, customer can buy it and fit it after purchase. This will reduce burden of roadtax. Their acessariies are not available easily and if availabe it too costly.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Feature wise it missing cosmetic detailing. Space is one of the best in class. You can compare with Tuscon. Road handling is also good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Diesel Engine is noisy its similar to what fortuner makes the sound. Fuel economy is good compare to its engine power its give good mileage. Gear box, dont know how long this will be smooth. If you really observe the vehicle their are lots of future plans for this vehicle. everywhere they left some or the other dummy sealed points. Might be in another 6 month, You may get switch to close the boot using  boot door keys also on the remote keys. Also one side of the sterring keys are blanks may be for cruse and other features.
Ride Quality & Handling Superb.
Final Words You cannot compare with Koriean brand its musch better than that. If you planning for Creata extend your budget and go for Jeep.
Areas of improvement As I told, its seems to me there are lots of future plans to enhance this vehicle. Remote Keys has 4 keys with two still to be added as a features.
the build quality is superb. Space is much more than Creta. Comfort is goodDashboard doesn't look like a cockpit if you compare with German car or even korean manufacturer",17-Feb-18,Sant,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/55395/
"I would like to talk about the performance. There is an inherent Clutch/gear issue. My clutch burnt at 13000 kms. The service center states that, the vehicle is not suitable for city conditions and the clutch has relatively smaller grooves, which makes it wear out faster. They claim, they have reported to the Jeep, but not sure if they will take any action. I got the clutch replaced, and am now getting clucking sound, whenever I change the gears, or slow down/speedup. The service center states its normal, but i can clearly see that, its not RIGHT. I have now no idea what to do now!!!",15-Nov-18,Senthil,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/62055/
"I am jeep owner from almost 2 years and after driving it more than 40k km I am writing this review. I don't advise people to buy it. Following are the pros and cons Pros..... 1) Its built quality and exterior is good. 2) You get good grip and control on high speed on highways. Cons...... 1) Jeep compass probably the worst SUV in its segment which has extremely poor and if I have to be blunt then pathetic turning radius and you literally have to take reverse on each U-turn in the city and if you are driving it cities like Mumbai, Bangalore then you are done. 2) even after taking care of the vehicle and getting it serviced on time the car started making noise. It's arm rest makes noise even the cover around steering wheel also not fitted well which also makes noise. 3) someone broke my wind shield which I got it replaced with new one but the size of new wind shield is little small and has not been fixed well it is making sound from the moment I got it fixed. 4) Most important point its engine stopped 3 times once on Express Highway and did not start then you have to wait for 20 minutes to get it started again which is terrible for a SUV where you have paid 20L. Even my 12 years old Honda City Engine never had this issue. 5) fabric seat covers after paying 20L is something you don't expect. In my opinion you should go for other SUVs instead of putting 20L in this or wait for another year to get better options as it has all basic features which you can get in any 10-12L car except electronic hand break. I bought this car thinking that its American brand and its going to be good product and after sales service but they have failed in both. They are selling inferior quality or they couldn't import quality which they sell in US or they are purposely selling poor quality products thinking that it's India and they can twist rules and regulations the way they want.",22-Jul-19,Ismail,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/99441/
"I purchased this car in recently and drove 800km in all conditions (in city/ highway etc---). I am getting an average mileage of 5.4 km/litre instead of 12-14 which company is offering. Please check the mileage of this car before buying this variant. It is a petrol variant with an engine capacity is 1.4, not worth to drive this car if you get an average of 5.4/km.",22-Sep-18,Johnson,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/57458/
"Exterior I don't really like huge SUV's (like the Fortuner or Endeavour) and in my opinion the Compass is just perfect. Its not too small and not too big. The design compliments the size very well giving it a superb road presence. I love the side profile and that chrome strip that differentiates the rood and the rest of the body. I love the rear which is complimented with a nicely done LED tail lights. (even non-led's looks good).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Top notch interiors made from great quality materials. The leather seats, soft touch dash, soft touch top portion on the front doors and that superbly finished leather wrapped steering gave me a sense of luxury right away. The doors close with a nice sound and bloody hell its hefty. I got into the driver seat & pulled the centre arm rest froward and adjusted it to my driving position and boy it felt like a tank once I was done. There is a sense of security which I have never felt in any other car I've driven so far. Space is good in the front but spaces to put phones and other items lack a bit.
With the front seats in my driving position, I got into the rear and it was spacious enough. The seats are great but the middle portion lack underthigh support. The rear arm rest is super wide and it felt like the car is best for 4 adults. Overall 4 adults and a kid is ideal or 3 medium sized adults.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I'm a true petrol head and the diesels I've driven so far (S-cross 1.3 and Polo) had failed to impress me with the turbo lag and I expected the same since the compass has a bigger engine and bigger turbo, but boy the engine and the power delivery blew me away. The engine is smooth and there is no jerk whatsoever when the turbo kicks in. With 5 well weighed adults in the car, it pulled from 1400rpm in 3rd gear with ease. It was so linear and clean that it almost felt like I was driving a powerfull petrol mill. The gear shifts are notchy which is well complimented by a nicely weighed clutch. The steering has a lot of feedback and weight and it instantly gave me a smile.
Ride Quality & Handling Handlig was great, I didn't feel like driving a 1.5 ton machine but there is a sense of heft and I think its mainly because of the well weighed chunky steering and the tank feel the Compass has.
I cannot comment much on ride quality since I drove on a good surface but on that it as good and the car changed directions with confidence and ease.
Final Words I'm in love with this car and there is no other way to put. If I was in the market to get a car around 15lakhs, I would happily put 5lakhs more and will get the Longitude (O) model since it has the most bang for the buck. We can spend 10k for Jeep's original leather wrapped steering (5k) and reverse camera (5k) to add to the Longi (O) and make it a limited model without LED tail lights and leather seats.
Areas of improvement
1. Should have had 6 airbags on limited 4x2 at least.
2. Should introduce the 8.4"" uConnect system since the 7"" one is laggy.
3. Cruise control and auto dimming IRVM would be a great addition.
PS : I cannot care less about having a sunroof and auto headlamps and wipers.

Very bad customer service. Great car brand but being run in india in worst possible way. There's no one accountable. Paid advance for the car July 2017 and still haven't got delivery and nobody is interested in resolving it. After 3 months of following up the answer is a sorry we can't deliver the car before 2 months which will make it one full year of booking for some who was amongst the first 100 bookings.,22-Feb-18,Siddharth,3,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/55423/
I hvnt drive this car yet but i love to drive this car soon its just like a dream for me. I found the features of this car very cool nd with a awesome power nd a dashing look makes it a perfect drive in this budget. The best part of jeep i mostly like They are giving u all security nd safety fetures in their base model like 6 airbags in their base model thats really cool doen't it. So there lot of gud things u will find in this car. So guys hurry up dont take much time.,31-Jul-17,Gaurav,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/48280/
"The buying experience was good. The only mistake I did, never checked the mileage of the car. I believed the sales person who told me the average mileage is 14-17km/L. The Jeep team is not ready to accept the mileage issues. I have sent several mails to the entire Jeep team and there were no reply and solution. I am getting an average mileage of 5-6KM/L after driving 2500km with different conditions. My humble request to all customers who are planning to buy Jeep compass, please check the mileage on different conditions (traffic /non traffic etc.) to get the real mileage. Do not believe the sales person who just want to sell the car.",16-Jan-19,johnson,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/72351/
"driving experience is good, handling is quite easy, no body rollover on bends Nice interior with lather seats only drawback seats are white so very hard to maintain after 2k rpm not much power it’s whole power lies between 1.5k -2k rpm post that engine sound gets louder back seat entrance is not that easy access i.e. you have to struggle a little bit if your short.",22-Dec-17,Rijee,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/49827/
"Exterior Great body, tough and head turner. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good features like eletronic break, comfortable seats and easy to drive.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I usually drive at maximum speed of 80-100, I have got fuel economy as 16.5 to 18km/l in city conditions and on highway it was 20 to 22.5km/l.
Ride Quality & Handling Great one.
Final Words I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied.
Till now I have driven around 4800 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 to 18km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 to 22.5km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour.
I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams.
As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good.
Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly.
I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call.
I am happy with my choice. If anyone wants to ask anything, feel free to write me.

"To, JEEP INDIA TEAM. Greetings of the Day !!! I recently bought the much hipped safety oriented INTERNATIONAL car JEEP COMPASS from your S G HIGHWAY BASED CONCEPT DEALER. The reason behind wiring this E-mail is to Replace my Faulty Car with New Jeep Model or money in cash. Just before few days when we were travelling on Ahmedabad to Surat Highway your Jeep Compass had serious build and make issue. While the running conditions at only 90KMPH the Fuel Pump (Diesel) Started Draining out Heavily. But to our fortune we smelled something wrong in the car and we immediately stop it by the side of highway. While inspecting the car on the highway we have found that its fuel pump was full of leakage and the diesel was draining out fast. As you already know that I have purchased it just before 6 Months and has drawn It for just about 20000 Kms with all regular paid services from your dealer. In any case your Jeep Compass Model in India is not conforming to the safety and performance standards of International Level which you try to claim in your much hipped marketing in television and other related medias. However, In that case I want full refund of my money or if you provide me enough assurance that this type of problem will not appear again in your vehicle than I shall be ready to have a new car from your company as a replacement to my existing car. I hope that Jeep India team will understand my situation as I am paying my hard earned money behind your faulty and damaged Jeep Compass car, I shall not be ready to collect back this faulty model from your dealership after repairs and would like to request the competent authority to provide prompt justification in my case on urgent basis. Due to your faulty model Jeep Compass my business plans are totally disturbed and I have already faced a moral and indirect lost of more than 1.5 Lakh Indian rupees during last week. In short, I am providing you the only two options to choose from before I personally litigate you in the court of Law: 1) Refund my Full Money of Jeep Compass and take back your Faulty Vehicle. 2) Replace this Faulty Vehicle with the New Vehicle and Provide me an Assurance in Writing that If the same problem is found (with in12 Months again) in the new piece of vehicle you shall be liable to refund my full money in Cash. I am writing this letter as a formal complain to justify my stand and provide time of 5 Days to your company authority before I initiate a legal procedures against your company and the dealer from where I have been made fool to purchase this faulty and damaged vehicle. Look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

"Exterior The outlook of the car is quite masculine, I love the fact that the design cues have been insprired from the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
The height of the car is also good, its pretty neat car for our Indian roads, which during monsoon become off-roads 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interior of the car is charismatic. Nice tone of black and white.... But I would have preferred an all round black interiors with a hint of red trimmings. That would have made it look more sexy.
The white colour is hard to maintain.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The car packs amazing punch in the engine. I've not driven the car yet but just sat in it when it was at display in our city. I have opted for the Diesel Automatic version which is expected to launch in the first week of Jan 2018
Ride Quality & Handling Again, Ive not driven the car so I cannot comment on this part. But I'm sure, after watching many reviews on youtube, this car is a drivers car!
Final Words I just hope and wish they dont price the Diesel Auto variant too steep, otherwise it will loose the charm, becasue if it crosses the 25 Lac barrier, then we have more alternatives to look at. Maybe they should launch the Trailhawk version in that price range
Areas of improvement The rear styling is something i did not lilke. Also, if you look at the car from sideways, you will notice that the rear wheels are not fitting perfectly in the rear wheel arch! That came as a surprise to me.
Jeep should give Mopar  accessories in India.
The front looks charming, the interiors are pretty good too!The rear tail light is not of my taste, the rear wheels do not fit properly in the wheel arch,",27-Aug-17,Manoj,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/48554/
"Exterior Best looking mid range SUV, good street presence. Front grille is a treat to the eyes. Squarish wheel wells add meat to the body. Built for off-roading terrains. The roof slides down to the rear giving a very Evoque feeling.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seats are the most comfortable in the segment. 5 seater hence people looking for 7/8 seater will most probably won't like it. Interior plastic quality is top notch. Is not be feature loaded like Hyundai's or Maruti's.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy, and Gearbox One of the best BHP figures. Economy decent although not as good as wafer-thin Japanese cars. It's either handling/build quality or economy... never both. Gearbox is smooth but sometimes gives a very stuck feeling still no issues faced. Diesel engine is same as Fiat which has been declared national engine of India.
Ride Quality & Handling It's a Jeep/Fiat then I don't need to comment on handling. Best suspension in class.
Final Words Best and solid built mid range SUV. Winner after Linea from Jeep/Fiat.
Areas of improvement Fiat/Jeep dealer network and after sales service.
Tank like build quality, performance, pricing...Maybe not feature rich but who cares about tons of useless features...",02-Aug-17,Anshul,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/48300/
"It's ultimate... never felt such a driving experience ever before. Superb... no sound... only power pickup and comfort.handle grip, suspension,sound, lights everything ultimate.

"Worst Customer Care in the Jeep Dealership at SRT Coimbatore and when Escalated to Jeep Company the Response is even more Worse. There is no one to care for customers pain points. The basic elementries of customer installation on delivery is being ignored. The overall experience of Jeep has been very bad. Feeling very sad for having bought a Jeep. Product is good, but it would certainly fail because of the customer service.",28-Feb-18,Prabhu,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/55470/
"1. Buying experience was not at all good as the sales executive told us that the milage of car is 17km/lt but it was just 6.5 km/lt. We asked the executive, he said wait for some time it will increase but after first service the result was same.

"Purchased 4x4 Limited Diesel, done about 600 km, in city roads mostly , not yet on highways, one month of ownership. Pros: 1)Excellent Suspension 2) Noise Reduction inside cabin is excellent 3) Pickup is so punchy 4) Premium interiors, great built quality. 5) Car music on alpine speakers are great, sound at its best. 6) Front grill look and back both are eye stealers. Cons: 1) Low speeds below 40 kmph was not so pleasant drive experience, engine noise can be heard inside as well., becomes smoother ride quality after 50 kmph. 2) City mileage around 11 km/lit with AC set in auto mode. 3) 17 inch alloy feels smaller for this size of car. 4) Infortainment system just ok. , Should have been having a inbuilt gps navigation. 5) turning radius feels longer",24-Dec-17,Jai,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/49843/
"On 27th July 2018 I was coming from Kapurthalla to Delhi, around 8:00 AM at Ambala my car (JEEP Campus HR 26 DJ 1503) stops and doesen't start.
I called RSA same time from Ambala, RSA team came at my place at 3:30 PM to pick my car. Then they take my car at JEEP Karnal Service center, there they took around 24 HRS to fix the issue, after reaching home I see that my Front Left tyre has some bubbles in it (which was changed / dameged by JEEP Karnal Service center).
I visited JEEP Service Center, Gurgaon on 3rd August 2018 to check the issue, there I can see that they put Maruti Alto car on shop flor and repairing the same, after making my many request they didn't lisiten to me(They told that we will repair MARUTI car first after that we will see JEEP). I called Mr. Tanuj Gupta (RSM), that doesn't support as well, after making my many call to custmer care arund 3:30 HRS they attend my car.

I was driving in city with my family n suddenly fire smoke started from front bonnet. My family scared n all side vehicle people started pointing me abt smoke. Some how I managed to park on side of the road , after 20-30 min smoke stopped. I tried all helpline number n staff number but no body has responded. I can say worst decision of my life to choose Jeep Compass.

"Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Very Poor . Breakdown within a week.
Ride Quality & Handling Ok.
Final Words Very poor.
Areas of improvement I have purchased Jeep Compass 2*4 Limited on 30th November. Delivery date was 5th December. Within a week the vehicle breakdown. Nobody know what happened.
I Have contacted Road assistance Services, They brought vehicle to the Service Center .They not even contacted me next 36 hrs .So I contacted jeep customer care dept on Tuesday 12 the December 2017.
They informed me vehicle is in Calicut service center. After this one  person name Mr Uday contacted me at evening, he  insulted me,and complaint my driving.All this issue put on my head. I have owned driving licences from 2001. I had owned 10 brands Benz, Audi,VW, Toyota etc including manual and automatic transmission. Anyway Now vehicle is in your Calicut Service center.
I have informed these things many times to customer care. Now more than 15 days over.I did not get any solution so far not even a single call in this regard. It means your don't have any responsibility to customers. Now you forced me take a decision, I don't want your vehicle.
I am going file a case against you at court of law and I will inform all the media including social media for justice.This issue affected me mentally and my day to day activities. You insulted my dignity as a human being and you makes financial losses, my valuable time and health.
Now 20 days Over There is no proper solution So far. I thing this is a premium vehicle. So I expected great service. But my experience was horrible with customer care and I did not get balance amount from the Land mark Mumbai Showroom yet. They are asking impossible things for refund. I have contacted global customer care team of Jeep (and FCA). But nothing happend.

I purchased it on 23/8 and totally satisfied with overall performance. Still no one taught how to use various options and yet to receive mopar accessories.... more care shud be taken on service point. Stepney they gave 16 inch and other 4 in 17 inch and I don't know the reason behind and no one to explain. Company shud take more steps to train peoples,01-Sep-17,Gowrishankar,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/48622/
"Exterior Eye catcher and amazing design.
Interior Comfort is good, but need to improve the seating cushion, somewhere i felt seating my in Swift Car was better (I mean driver seat).
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good engine and decent fuel economy considering it is 2 CC engine. Gear box makes thud noise when you are in wrong gear and engine stops running. It is scarry.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good and even handling, I really appreciate the strong built reason being when I was cruising at 120 speed, a pebble flew from trucks tyre and hit right on the windsheild at drivers side. Not even a scratch or mark noticed.
Only problem is there is some noise coming out from dashboard which is very irritating, looks like assembling is not done well. This has been from day 1 and I drove 16500 KM and its been 7 Months.
Bought this car from Pride Motors Hyderabad and have given to service center 4 times and issue still persist. You may want to test drive the car before getting it registered. Not sure if dealers would give the choice to test drive a car before registering in your name.
Areas of improvement You are paying 23 Lakhs, there shouldn't be no noise from door panels or dashboard, which is very annoying and becomes irritating when you go for long drive. I am giving the car for 5th time for service, hopefully it gets fixed.
Solid Built, fantastic engine, good looks and decent fuel economy depending on the traffic and speedRear visibility, front parking sensors not available and GPS navigation missing in Limited edition.",12-Jun-18,Mohammed,3,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/56314/

"Don’t buy it from Jayaraj Motors (Tiruchirappalli)!! I purchased a ‘Jeep Compass Limited’ vehicle on March 2018 in the name of my company ‘*Rubine Glass Pvt Ltd*’ at Jayaraj Motors, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu. While purchasing I was told by the sales rep Mr. Jambukeshwar and Sales Manager (I think so) Muthu that there is no discount available for Jeep Compass even if 2 or 3 nos of vehicles bought together. This had been their repeated answer when I insisted for discount.
After purchasing the vehicle, my company was followed up many times by their (Jayaraj Motors) staff Mr. Jambukeshwar in the month of April to purchase second vehicle of same model with a discount of ?80,000/-.
When it was brought to my notice, I contacted Mr. Jambukeshwar and expressed my discontent for the false & unethical statement given to me during the time of first vehicle’s purchase and insisted to offer the discount of? 40000 for the first vehicle. After a long discussion, Mr. Jambukeshwar agreed that ?25000 of discount for my vehicle even in the case of second vehicle not purchased. When I contacted him for the cheque for the discounted amount and overpaid amount for Engine Insurance, he said only? 15000 as discount along with the overpaid amount can be given stating that as per MD’s instruction.
Since I was not in an mood to make it a scene, I asked him to pay the amount immediately. Again after few days, when I contacted him he said he was relieved from the company and Ms. Uma and Mr. Muthu will handle the issue of returning the amount. When I contacted Ms. Uma, she accepted that jambu had instructed to pay the amount and she was waiting for company’s MD’s signature on the cheque.
This was going on for around 3 weeks stating that ‘MD is not in the city.’ After she asked me to contact Mr. Muthu stating he will handle on this regard. When I explained Mr.Muthu over phone, he said he would speak to MD and get the amount. Irrespective of my repeated reminders to him in a space of every two days, he kept on saying the different excuses for almost a month. Thereafter, he started avoiding my phone calls.
(Only auto messages are received that he would contact shortly). Then, I wrote to their MD Mr. Ajay on 12th July about all what happened in the perception that he wouldn’t have known their Staff’s irresponsible and false commitments. He immediately responded that action will be taken. But till date, no action was taken. It’s really hurting and I feel insulted & cheated as a customer. And because of this, I couldn’t even enjoy the feel and ride of my new vehicle.
But, I don’t have any complaints about the vehicle. As of now, It is to my expectation. But, don’t buy it from an irresponsible and unethical dealer like Jayaraj Motors. Or negotiate with them like in a vegetable market (but nowadays, their prices are trustworthy) and get it in writing. More you bargain, more discount you may get (apart from company offers). These guys will surely spoil the reputation of the brand ‘JEEP’ in India..

To say the least, the JEEP has forced to make time frim my work and start living that collegue life of long drives with those never ending talks and discussions about life once again. It is a monster of an engine and the sleek gear box with that great aluminium finish round gear box is so silky smooth. Of course, there are some niggles but that cannot take away the sheer joy it gives me everytime I am behind the wheels. It is an epitome of go anywhere kind of freedom.",25-Apr-19,Gaurav,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/88887/

"I bought the jeep compass limited 4×4 in july under there upgrade plan for 4×4. So i purchased the car at a price of 23 lac instead of 25 lac on road. One thing i would i to say is that this is the beast when it comes to pure driving experience. No suv under 35 lac can beat it in terms of performance. I have one problem regarding some features but many of them has already been included in the limited plus trim at a cost of 2 lac more, so no issue of that also. My only suggestion to Jeep india is to price the longitude option model at 21 lac on road because of the newely arrived harrier. And please launch a diesel automatic in limited trim. If they do this than definitely there sales will reach around 1800 units a month. My suggestion to customer is if you are planning for a SUV and your budget is over 21-22 lac than definitely go for compass. But if your budget is tight around 18-19 lac than go for harrier XZ over creta and other. Remember one thing only the XZ model of harrier is good to purchase because the rest of models lacks safety features which are on my priority number 1.",25-Jan-19,Sushant,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/74299/

"Buying experience of Jeep Compass is completely good package because of its safety features, brand value, commanding design, fun to drive and off-road chops. Riding experience is outstanding specially in diesel variant because it is more powerful than it's rivals. Ride Quality is outstanding and amazing on the highways is a great cruiser around the corners and stability of this car is perfect. The looks of compass remains one of the most attractive design in its segment with its seven-slat grille and squared off wheel arches proudly proclaiming it's iconic jeep heritage. Performance is excellent around the corners and body roll is excellent on the highways. Compass 4×4 limited plus variant goes over the off-off-road with ease because of its independent suspension. Servicing cost and maintenance cost is very reasonable and jeep have introduced Mopar, the global giants in all jeep vehicles. Mopar is one-stop shop for your jeep vehicle's, maintenance, service, performance upgradesupgrades and cosmetic increases, so your jeep vehicle stays in perfect condition for your adventures always. Pros and Cons: PROS: 1.) It gets panaromic sunroof in top of the variant. 2.) Acceleration is outstanding than its rivals. 3.) Fit and finish is excellent and interior quality is top notch and feel premium than its rivals. 4.) Class leading off road capabilities with its independent suspension. 5.) Smooth Manual Gearbox and easy to use. 6.) Owing to Off-Road charactercharacter, compass gets four driving in top of the variants in its selec- Terrain all wheel drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud to adjust engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7.) Diesel motor is punchier, nicer to drive and good highway cruiser. CONS: 1.) Too Pricey 2.) Poor Rear Seat Comfort and feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3.) Clutch of Diesel variant is much heavier and not good for city use. 4.) 7 speed DCT Automatic is not very smooth, quickest, lacks punch and feels jerkiness. 5.) Missing some features. 6.) Petrol engine is very noisy than its rivals. 7.) The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.",26-Jul-19,Vineet,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/99914/

After sales service very poor. Not providing warrenty as you put car for repair under warrenty it will not come back for months and they will say part is not available. But when you say you are ready to pay for that part it will be available from next day. Service staff very bad. Frequent break down. No proper service support.

"I had to write this review. It’s been about 5 months since I am driving Jeep Compass and mileage on odo just crossed 12,000 km. Bought it on 21 Feb 2019. Car was available quickly as they were clearing off 2018 stock and I got approx 90k benefits. Buying experience was awesome, smooth and spotless. I requested my chosen day delivery which Landmark Gurgaon guys were able to accommodate. First look of car and must say I fell in love with this machine. Car was delivered around 7 pm on 21st Feb which was a bit late. Didn’t know if any pre-delivery checks needed to be carried out by dealership guys at that point of time. But just got the car keys handed over in a ceremonial style with dealership guys clapping and taking pictures of key handing over. First 500 KM: Spotless except one incident. Just before 500km on odo, car suddenly stopped and would not start. “Service Engine” message was popping up on instrument panel. I had to wait for about half an hour before trying to start the engine. Engine started but it was enough for me to get worried. Called up my dealership contact and told him about the incident. Next day he sent someone from dealership and the “engine service” message was taken care of presumably by hard resetting car’s info message panel. My dealership contact told they had topped up engine oil and done pre-delivery checks which were not done at the time of delivery. I was surprised how could they miss that! But didn’t know myself about this check at the time of delivery. First 5000 km: Got my first free servicing done at 5000 km.Experience was quite nice. Service center in Sector 34 Gurgaon had AC waiting hall and offered coffee and water. It took around 5 hours in servicing. They did wheel alignment and balancing apart from topping up all oils. Interior and exterior of car got cleaned. I had two long trips by this time: first of about 1300 km to and fro Delhi-Haridwar-Mussoorie-Delhi with a bit of detour and second of about 2000 km to and fro Delhi-Lucknow-Gorakhpur-Muzzafarpur-Delhi. Overall driving experience was awesome. It was March and weather was still a bit cold. Took Yamuna Expressway and newly built Agra-Lucknow Expressway. Fuel economy was roughly around 13.5 km/litre for both trips. Must say road grip and stability of Compass is way too superior. Cruising at around 120-160 mark was effortless and never realized till the time I saw odometer. Happy happy except one incident where I got a big dent on driver’s side rear door while backing up and didn’t got idea of side wall and got rubbed against it - thinking it would have been better should Jeep have provided 360 degree view camera which we see in one segment lower Kicks and recently launched Hector. However, came back Delhi and got it claimed through 0 dep insurance. Total bill was Rs. 7500 and I had to pay Rs. 2000 as deductible. The D-Day: This is when I became really disappointed with Jeep Compass, Jeep India team and Landmark dealership. I was again on a long road trip of around 2000 KM stretch back to my hometown Gopalganj and was traveling across Yamuna Expressway. It was 1:30 pm on a hot sunny day on 25-May-2019 with temperature ranging about 45 degrees and my odo mileage around 8800 KM. I was traveling along with my pregnant wife, mom and my puppy Blaze at a speed between 90-100 km/hour. Just before Mathura toll plaza of Yamuna Expressway, my passenger side rear Tyre got burst into pieces. I could smell something burning in my cabin and was about to apply brakes when I felt a sudden jolt but still could not figure out what went wrong. I didn’t lose control of my steering wheel, didn’t apply brakes, took off my leg from accelerator and just let wheels roll over. When speed was less than 60 km/hour I applied brakes slightly and then immediately released. By this time, I knew some Tyre got burst as car was wobbling. I put on my left side indicators and started moving toward side curb. After about 0.7 KM from the location where Tyre got burst, I was able to pull over the curb. Luckily, cars traveling behind me, saw this entire episode happening right in front and slowed down. I was in complete shock, out of mind and didn’t know how to react for a brief time once I stopped. Three cars stopped to know our well-being and helped me over with Tyre change. One of the guy from those cars also brought back the burst piece of Tyre lying more than half km behind and I could see few burn marks in his hand because of the heat from burst Tyre. I averted a major personal catastrophe which could well have life long implications on my remaining family if we were not able to survive on so called Road to Hell cemented Yamuna Expressway. Bursting of Tyre was totally unexpected given I had checked air pressure just before starting the trip and it was just 3 months 4 days old car having 8800 km on odo. I was so infuriated and agitated that I immediately called up Jeep India customer care and Landmark service center to report this incident. Resolution Provided for Burst Tyre from Jeep India and Landmark dealership: Tyre is not covered directly by Jeep and coverage comes from Tyre manufacturer which in this case is Bridgestone. Firestone Tyres manufactured by Bridgestone is used in Jeep Compass up to Limited Plus editions. After inspection of the burst Tyre, Bridgestone told that burst happened due to side wall damage of Tyre because of low/flat pressure and not because of any manufacturing defect and rejected the claim. Jeep India replaced the burst Tyre free of cost as a goodwill gesture. I knew my Tyres were in good condition, almost new and also had checked the air pressure before starting the trip, so there was no way air pressure would come down. I told them that Tyre was not able to handle the heat generated by cemented Yamuna Expressway on a hot sunny noon and as a result oxygen inside the Tyre would have expanded to a limit which the Tyre was not able to handle and got burst. I googled about Jeep Compass Tyre burst and could spot few reviews where people have faced similar Tyre bursts in a hot day because of the substandard quality of Firestone Tyres used in Jeep Compass. I spent around 24 lakhs to buy this vehicle just to know that Tyres are not covered by Jeep warranty and Tyre manufacturer Bridgestone would not accept claim giving rubbish reasons of low/flat Tyre pressure. Jeep should have provided this vehicle without Tyres and would have asked customers to choose Tyres of their choicest manufacturer since warranty is covered by manufacturer. I asked Jeep India team to provide Firestone Tyre compatibility and safety check report for Jeep Compass on Indian road conditions which they must have done before launching Jeep Compass but they failed to provide. I went through online Consumer Affair portal and lodged a complaint against Jeep Compass for this incident and to ask them to replace my all four Tyres with a much reliable Tyre brand like Michelin or Goodyear but none outcome to my favor!",16-Jul-19,Chandan,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/98897/

Took again there and they kept it there for about 10 days and said some parts are replaced. After driving of around 100kms engine started emitting some burning smell. When I lifted bonnet and engine cover I am finding oil leakage from somewhere. I'm frustrated now as what to do as no satisfactory response from dealership or company.

This car is awesome. But price is very high. It's not for middle class. And also maintaince cost also may become high... And jeep compass is also successful model in india because of some models are affordable for middle class their are base and second one. But jeep trailhawk's base is also high for middle class. It's may be negative for middle class who look if for this car but price is high fo there.,06-Jun-19,Babu,3,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/93812/
This is the car which I was waiting for from last two years. I had purchased XUV 500 and Creta 1.6 during last few years. But the thing I loved in JEEP COMPASS is its drive and its road presence. Comfort is good and power is unmatchable from my previous cars. Though some people are not happy with mileage but I know I am driving 2.0 L with gem of a power and mileage figures are not hurting me as 14.7 kmpl is not that bad. The sector in Jeep which i am worried for is after sales service. fingers crossed for that. Overall I am an proud owner and I am in love with the machine.,29-May-18,Iqbal,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/56184/
"Lets make it short and simple. 1. Jeep doesn't have alot of dealers and most cities have just one. These people kind of hold a monopoly position so getting better deals is next to non. These dealers usually have a very obsolete method of ordering cars which ends up extending the delivery date from the date of booking for over a month in most cases. 2. Compass feels sturdy and rides over most bumps with super ease. The car is still a little bit on the stiffer side so some bumps can get to you in a little more aggressive manner but that leads to a better handling car which for it's size is pretty darn great. There is the typical turbo lag under 1.8k RPM but not very zombie-ish types. There is a good punch of power right after the mark but tbh, it doesn't feel like a 170ish bhp car. Maybe thats the output at crank and not at wheels. The cabin might be a little small for people who expect to carry a soccer team in a 23L car but for 4 adults, space is more than enough. Top of all that, it gets a panoramic sunroof which is lovely, especially during the summers where it'll get you skin tanned to a 4th degree burn!! Well jokes aside, it does make the cabin a lot more appealing and even the car as a whole feels more worth the price with the addition of a few new features in the limited plus option but strangely misses out on cruise control(i dont see much use of it but most people i spoke to about he car hate this miss) The looks of the car comes down to your perspective. I truly believe this car looks amazing especially in the dark grey shade with the black glossy roof. The only point of uncertainty is the reliability issues coming up with this car. A few common issues are- A) premature clutch burn B) brakes failure C) electronics failure (music system, startstop) D) poor quality control (exposed parts in the interior and water leaking into taillight) But I'd still go for the car for the premium feeling interior or i might not got for it thanks to white colour leather seats and arm rest which will get soiled in less than an hour in Indian climate conditions Thanks.",11-Oct-18,Om,3,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/58233/

"Exterior The looks are a wee bit similar to Range Rover Évoque. All in all a “cute” beast. The front grill looks very good. The material used for the body is really good and heavy.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interiors are plush and of high quality. the infotainment system could hav been better. Satnav is missing. Apple CarPlay dosent work seamlessly as maps app doesn’t open. Haven’t tried with Android though. Seats are plush and ample leg room.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Possibly the best performance even in a segment highper than it. You are never short of reserve power. Has given a mileage of 14.3/L in mixed driving conditions. It’s a dream to shift gears.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is excellent and handling is good.
Final Words The infotainment system along with the lack of features may dissuade you from buying but the performance and the looks are unmatched in thus segment.

"Exterior Exterior looks stylish like cherokee. seven grills look fabulous.It does look smaller in some angles but if you view it from the side it looks bigger. Metallic gey is nice,Black colour is the best it looks bigger and red with black hood is quite cool.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is quite nice.Front leg room is good and we can view the road easilyI personally didnt like the white colours as they can get bad.didnt like the dummy buttons in steering. Also it would have been nice if there was a lock for changing between drive modes (mud, sand) because i have been told that if you do that while drriving the engine might get bad.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Awesome pull in the high ranges.Fuel ecnomy is very good. While driving with AC on you get 14 kmph else you get 17kmph. The best part is gearbox although the clutch is a little low shifting is so easy.
Ride Quality & Handling It is as if I am riding a car having good ground clerance. Handling is swift.It has lesser turning radius.
Final Words Jeep better than all among competitors.Stylish comfortable you name it. I think I am going to see them a lot in the roads.Hope the service network also does with the expectations.

"I bought my car from Jeep store @omr RDC royale on Januar 4th 2018. The buying experience was good barring a couple of days delay. They even arranged for the pujas to be done prior to taking delivery of the car. I was very thrilled to take it on the highways, but had to wait 3 months for that to happen. And finally when the day came it was all the more exciting. The sheer torque and the power of the car made it feel like flying on the highways. The steering was always in control even at 170 kmph. The car felt well grounded at high speed overtakes and on the straight line too. One thing i was really disappointed with was the mileage which i got only 12.5 kmpl even on the highways. My hometown doesn't have good roads as we see in the metros, but my Jeep was able to tackle all the bad patches. With ease, which is a testimony to the ride quality of the car. Although everything was going good, when i was returning home from a long drive i noticed that the ESP warning had started glowing. That is the only problem i have faced with the vehicle till now. Although i was disappointed with this problem, i feel its a minor issue and would be sorted out easily.

"The buying experience wasn't really nice because the dealers knew nothing much about the car at all but when it comes to performance it's got a fiat engine after all Italian hence it really gives you the luxury feel and power at the same time, looks wise is really aggressively attractive no doubt. I think they have put in some satisfying power for an SUV and the only cons is the low clearance as I stay in a state where the roads are really uneven in certain areas hence it still hits the front bumper but I mean big potholes it would have been great if it was design in 18 inch tyres too maybe.

Interior look very cheap. Rear seat is not comfortable for a long drive. Comfort wise Hyundai creta is way better. It’s a plastic car I would say. Nothing other than looks.

The comparison of this car is not at all with creta top end or xuv500 or tata harrier, this car stands apart. Had gone upto 170km/hr but still the vehicle was under my control. Ride and handling is excellent. The NVH level is well within control. Mileage should be more than 10 as i have driven only 500km and each time there's an increment in mileage.

"Buying experience of Jeep compass sport model is too good because it is the base model of Jeep compass starting from 15 laks onwards. Riding experience of this model is a top notch in both city and highway but on highway is a great cruiser. The body roll of Jeep compass is outstanding around the corners and stability is also outstanding on the highways and which is the best in the segment. This is the only petrol SUV comes with maximum power around 161bhp and highest than its rivals. Looks of Jeep Compass is the best in its segment with seven slat grille with commanding design, looking dynamic and looks sportier. Performance is outstanding with 1.4 litre petrol engine because it drives smoothly, punchier and nicer to drive. Jeep compass petrol mileage around 15 to 16 kmpl on the highways if you drive not too much fast and in city 10 to 12 kmpl. Servicing and maintainence of compass is reasonable and not much expensive in petrol variants while in diesel it is too expensive to maintain the vehicle and while servicing cost is expensive. PROS: 1. It comes with safety features such as EPB, ESP, Hill Start Assist, Roll Over Mitigation, All Disc Brakes, Traction Control and Hill Descent Control as standard. 2.) 6 speed manual gearbox is joy and easy to use. 3.) Class leading off road capabilities. 4.) Build quality and interior quality is a top notch and best in the segment. 5.) Plastic quality and materials are used on the compass are extremely superb and best in its class. 6.) The individual suspension set up of the compass which further increases its off-road capabilities. CONS: 1. Missing some features like cruise control, electric ORVM turn indicators, alloy wheels and other features etc. 2. Poor rear seat comfort and feels cramped for three adults. 3. The petrol engine is noisy than the other rivals like creta and hector. 4. Too pricey 5. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking. 6. 7 speed DCT automatic transmission is not very smooth, quickest, lacks punch and feels jerkiness on the highways.",30-Jul-19,Vineet,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/100281/

"I have always been a fan of the Compass since it was launched back in 2017. Being a student and a big car enthusiast, it was really hard to convince my parents to choose this car over the Creta (There was a 5 lakh rupees price difference!). Recently, my best friend got the newly launched Sport Plus 1.4 Petrol variant of the Compass(Harrier effect, maybe?). And I must say, I wish my family had waited for this. He surprisingly agreed to take the Compass for a road trip to Rishikesh which we've been planning for days and I got to drive this beauty for quite a while to write this review. Under the hood, this two-wheel-drive car packs the same Fiat-sourced 1.4 litre turbo petrol engine producing 160 bhp of power and 250 Nm of torque which we've already seen in the top spec variants. The car is loaded! We get 16 inch Alloy wheels, roof rails, dual zone automatic climate control, a 5 inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers and all the standard safety features along with the signature electronic parking brake. One more thing, there's a hidden easter egg near the bonnet of the car and it's just better that you notice it yourself. Some people might find the infotainment unit smaller compared to the 7 inch one seen in higher variants, but not us! It doesn't have a stock rear parking camera, but you can install that as an accessory. The speakers work really well. Also, conventional headlamps are provided with this variant and there's no sunroof on offer. Now let's talk about driving this beauty. This car, is a beast! The turbo kicks in after 2300 rpm and you get that kick in the pants feeling. This car crushed all the bad roads which we encountered in the hills. Although the suspension is a bit on the stiffer side, body roll is negligible and the Compass feels so much alive when you're cruising through those corners and the brakes work very well. Arguably this variant, the Sports Plus, will give you the most bang for your buck. It packs all the necessary features, and even more! This is a proper driver's car with much practicality on offer. Priced at 15.60 lakhs ex-showroom, I would definitely recommend this Compass to all the interested buyers in this segment. Definitely a 5 star rating from my side!",14-Jun-19,Kashish,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/94658/
Its a dream car for any man..i love the way it moves in highway.. 175 BHP cant compare to any other vehicle in this segment..solid body..music system is too good..i wanted to buy top most model but waiting period was 3 months so opted for limited option..no regrets..just go for it guys happy motoring...:),27-Feb-19,satish,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/80836/

"Buying experience: I bought my Car from landmark Gurgaon. The salesperson was good but the company is very rigid about discounts or they didn't provide any additional accessories.
Riding experience: Riding experience was ok but nothing so great about it.
Details about looks, performance etc: Looks were the deciding factor why I bought this car.
Servicing and maintenance: This is the worst part of this company. I sent my car for repair to Okhla, New Delhi landmark because of wrong fuel injected into my car. They will charge you like anything, absurd labour charges. They sent me a bill of 1.35Lakh and didn't offer any discount despite multiple requests.
Pros and Cons: Pro: Looks of the car. Cons: 1. Petrol model is not powerful enough. 2. The average is not more than 8. 3. Service centres are the worst. Be ready to pay a very heavy amount if anything goes bad. 4. In Delhi/NCR dealer has a monopoly. You don't have any alternative.",15-Apr-19,Vineet,1,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/87785/

"The Compass has been an amazing car to drive around especially in the highways. The looks are worth the buck and its handling is something worth mentioning.Though it lacks a cruise control unlike most other cars in the segment, Jeep has made sure that the interior features are not disappointing.Another highlight of the car is its Audio system , with the deep bass and clear audio.Overall its a midsized SUV with great reliability and good performance.",27-Oct-18,Arjun,5,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/59370/

"Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all round performances. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class leading off roading capabilities 2. The engine is extremely frugal and responsive 3. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp portions and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching attraction of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass Customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 4. Owing to off road characters, compass gets four driving modes in its selec-Terrain all-wheel drive system such as auto, snow, sand, and mud-the system adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 5. The individual Suspension set up of the Jeep Compass further increases its off road capability. 6. Plastic quality and material used on the Compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor near seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT automatic gearbox is not ver smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. Engine is quite noisy its silent in diesel engine. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down it lacks the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.",03-Aug-19,Ishan,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/100595/
"I bought a Jeep Compass Longitude optional a year back in Sep 2017 and was enjoying my rides like any other users, the overall performance of the vehicle is as good as expected, BUT when I went for the service my overall experience is turned down. I met with a minor accident and went for servicing the car at TURBO auto in Vijayawada, Andhrapradesh as I have only one choice in this city and they informed me that radiator and inter cooling system needs to be replaced along with the front bumper. It took 11 days for them to complete the work as I understood that the time would take for them in general is not more than 2 or 3 days. the reason as I understood is the spare parts was not being maintained by the service centres and I wonder the first thing that will get damage is the bumper and radiator when a car meets with the accident. Though I got the comprehensive insurance, when went to take the vehicle for delivery I was asked to pay 8600 Rs additional amount as they installed a bumper with chrome which they claim is not covered by the insurer (Bharathi Axa). which after enquiry with the service advisor understood that the part which the service centre guys ordered somehow changed ( I wonder how this could happen for a service oriented industry's these days) and when I denied to pay for what I have not asked neither chose the service centre guys denied to deliver the vehicle and asked for one more day to remove the chrome from the bumper to and deliver the vehicle and I have to leave the vehicle again at service centre to fix the right one. So after all these experiences I wonder why I chose a vehicle which is good to drive but very bad when you have to get it repaired.",06-Dec-18,Krishna,2,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/65780/

Jeep compass has 2.0l multijet engine that produces 171bhp and 350Nm of torque that is impressive in this segment and powerful in its segment.

"Buying Experience: I had a decent buying experience from Landmark Gurgaon. Although, they changed the delivery timelines twice but the Sales Manager was responsive, mostly. Riding Experience: Majorly, its been very good riding experience. On the Highways, its one of the best monocoque SUVs on the Indian roads. In city conditions, the ride can get a bit bumpy due to stiff suspension, however, there's a very reassuring feeling to be in this cabin. Looks & Performance: Looks for this butch SUV is the trump card. It looks premium and sure is a head-turner with those 18 inch alloys. For the performance, I'd rate this as a decent 4/5. Although, there's a bit of a lag initially (due to the turbo), however, if you get the hang of throttle response you can actually make the pick-up very linear. It has a very strong mid range and pulls very nicely for the weight of this car and never feels under powered. Service & Maintenance: I've got my car services once and the experience was fine. However, i believe there's an issue with the Battery from most buyers i have spoken to. Pros: Great looks, Safety features and robust cabin, convenient to drive with Automatic, fit & finish of the cabin Cons: Not great on Value for money especially compared to Kia Seltos, few key features missing in Indian version like Cruise Control, Fuel economy can be underwhelming for few for petrol auto.",23-Sep-19,Tarun,4,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews/104611/

"Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV.

"Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all-round performance. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking."," Jul 14, 2019 ",By Vineet Sharma,5,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/the-most-complete-suv-72243.htm

"My name is Johnson Correya and I currently reside in Powai (Mumbai). I have purchased a petrol model Jeep Compass Sports Variant with Manual Transmission. Before buying the vehicle, I had checked reviews on different websites about this vehicle and discussed the features with the sales team, especially with the salesperson from the Landmark Mumbai showroom (Abhishek). All automobile related sites and the salesman had claimed that the mileage for this model is 14-17 km/liter. I don't have any other problems with this model except the mileage for which I am getting an average of 5 to 5.5 km/liter with a mixture of conditions like traffic, without traffic and high way etc. I approached the CRM Mr. Salim who asked me to bring the car for a check-up. I dropped the vehicle off on 14/11/18 after completing 1200 km. I had reset the meter just before I dropped the vehicle at the service center. Service adviser Prateek attended my vehicle and suggested me to come back after 3 days as they wanted to test the entire vehicle. I complied and collected the vehicle after 3 days had elapsed. While I was collecting the vehicle, he informed me that they had checked the vehicle in traffic conditions and they had gotten 10 km/liter with no other technical issues in the vehicle. They have written the average mileage as 10 km/liter in the service form. I checked the mileage meter just after leaving the service center then I realized that the mileage was 4.5km/liter and they have driven the vehicle 14.5 km. It was a barefaced lie which they told me that they got 10 km/liter in traffic conditions. I had informed the mileage issue to the CRM (Salim) again. He had suggested that he would send one person with me to check my driving pattern. He had sent Aditya Dhere on 23.11.18 at 6 pm at my office. He accompanied me for 2 km in traffic conditions. He understood that the issue is with the mileage and not with my driving patterns. He had taken a picture of the mileage meter and sent it to the CRM. We got 2.2 km/liter for around 2 km drive with 25 minutes of travel. I don't travel always in traffic, 5-5.5 is an average of a mix (all conditions). It is not worth driving this vehicle with the kind of average I get and why the company is offering an impossible mileage of 14-17 km/liter is ludicrous and preposterous. They haven't given any solution till date. My humble request to the customers, please do not buy Jeep compass as they are selling the car with fake commitments."," Jan 17, 2019 ",By Johnson,1,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/petrol-driking-mechine-avrage-56kml-27871.htm

"We are a family of four and we all are really fond of cars including my little one 2 years old as well. The elder 10 year old son can rattle the power and torque figures of different cars. Most of the cars we have owned are driving oriented and we always take the build quality, driving dynamics and safety as top priorities every time we choose a new car. Just to name the cars in our fleet in the past, we owned Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Skoda Yeti and Laura. All these cars gave brilliant experience with well sorted performance. But choosing the Yeti successor was quite a difficult task as the list of priorities increased all these years. We shortlisted the priorities which included nice driving dynamics, strong build quality and safety, leather steering wheel, leather seats, silent/powerful diesel engine, spaciousness, distinct styling and of course, the hill hold control since I have phobia of rolling back. So, fortunately we were able to shortlist the cars and the list included Renault Duster, Audi Q3, BMW X1, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Tiguan and Jeep Compass. The Audi and BMW were rejected due to fact that our regular drives to the outskirts where my grandparents live would prove a nightmare for these cars. Skoda Kodiaq and VW Tiguan were outrageously priced for what they offer while we listed out Renault Duster because it lacks adequate safety features. So, the last option remained in the list which was meeting all our expectations was Jeep Compass. Now coming to the initial experience, man, it's a head turner. Wherever I take my blazing red Jeep Compass, it really grabs eyeballs. It has pretty striking similarity with the Range Rover Evoque, especially the blackened roof. My wife is really smitten with this car, during the early drive of 40 kms, we drove equally for 30 kilometers. The car is exceptionally comfortable to drive with the engine barely audible from inside even if you cruise at the speed of 80kmph. The 2.0L engine produces 173PS and 350Nm of peak torque with the SUV giving above 16kmpl mileage in mix conditions which is pretty much acceptable given the stature of the car. With linear acceleration, the vehicle can reach the 80-90kmph mark in no time. The engine is quite smooth and does not have turbo lag unlike other cars we owned in the past. Coming to the part which I liked the most is the robust quality this car comes with. It is heavy especially the doors, hood and the tailgate. The car comes with all the safety aspects which we needed including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill start assist, electronic parking brake and ISOFIX rear child seat mounts. The braking is adequate and it comes to halt in the straight line without any fuss. In terms of comfort inside, the car is an absolute bliss with enough legroom at the rear which most people complain about in the car. The car has all the contemporary gizmos including the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto support and a very effective air conditioner. However, the sound output from the AV system was mediocre although one can always add extra speakers to increase the decibels. Driven over 3000kms so far and it has been a wonderful experience with this car. Anyone who wants a little show-off with utter cabin comfort, safety and smooth engine performance, I think Jeep Compass can be a good choice under Rs. 25 lakhs."," Nov 19, 2018 ",By Shailendra,5,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-my-experience-after-driving-3000kms-21737.htm

They are committed for after sales service but they may have a practical issue with on -road service or stock issue as they are rising and not completely established. But Jeep is always known for Lavish driving and safety. If you are a passionate driver then this Car is for you. I drove almost 4000 KM in a month. I had a good experience.

"I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied. Till now I have driven around 3350 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour. I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams. As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good. Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly. I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call. I am happy with my choice.

As we drove down the highways, the car felt well planted and I didn?t have to switch gears very frequently in order to keep the car moving, which made it pretty relaxing to drive.

"As and when Compass comes with AT 4x4 it will cost atleast 23.5 and obviously as it is a new launch there are no discount offers. Tucson with discount offers between 1-1.5 L is going to be available for almost the same price as the AT 4x4 Compass. Therefore a Tucson which is bigger, more powerful, more fuel efficient, better dynamically designed, more reliable, better ASS network, better looking ( depends on ones own taste), drives more like a sedan ( most of ones driving is going to be on metalled roads), needs serious considerations.As far as brand value (snob value ) is concerned worldwide Hyundai sells more Tucson than Jeep selling compass and has better ratings.In fact Jeep products are at the bottom of the rung. Now the present compass may be a new vehicle and may behave differently but it is still untested. A short test drive is not enough to test a vehicle which is going to cost more than 25 L.

"Good to be back again?this time I am writing a review for the Jeep Compass Longitude Diesel MT. This is the mid segment jeep in the compass series. To start with let me tell you the vehicle is absolutely ?SOLID? heavy build and gives you an impeccable presence wherever you go. So lets talk engine dynamics, the diesel engine of this baby is a 2 Ltr Multijet diesel engine meshed with a 6 speed gear box yielding 173 PS power which is sufficient to propel this vehicle really fast. The acceleration is good but the pickup still might need some work. It can be blamed on the heavy build of the vehicle as the engine after all is 2 ltr. The breaking is pretty efficient as I did try the odd ball 60 KM/HR to ?0? breaking and the vehicle responded perfectly telling me that the ABS and EBD systems gelled perfectly. Let?s talk driving comfort now, although the gear shifts are smooth but the clutch does require some pushing and in city driving you might get a bit of a foot ache if you are not used to it. The vehicle can power down if you are at a low speed trying to drive at a higher gear. One thing I really loved was the electronic parking brake which replaced a hand brake with a nifty little button where the hand brake used to exist. Now coming to the ergonomics on this vehicle, the instrument cluster is well lit and the infotainment system has just the right features. I bought the Longitude and not the optional so features like car play and android auto were not available. They did provide a usb port in the rear which was pretty good. There were a couple of things which did disappoint like there was no climatronic AC, although the door handled has leathered upholstery the seats were fabric which was very disappointing and the Jeep accessory for the seat costed about 16000 MRP. The car has reverse parking sensors but no camera which is not one would expect after paying a good amount for this car and lets face it, it doesn?t cost much. Another things which was painful was that the car?s speaker system was absolutely flat no zing to it. The car does have traction control but not sure how much of that you would use. In summary the car is excellent in terms of handling and well grounded, the features are there but for the price I paid I expected much more. Overall, if you would really like a Jeep with all the bells and whistled go for a Longitude Optional or Limited. Happy and safe driving."," Dec 27, 2017 ",By Samriddh Mangotra,4,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-a-great-value-for-money-suv-18826.htm

Buy it for Brand, Quality, performance and style."," Oct 17, 2017 ",By Ishrat Aziz,4,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/brand-quality-style-18563.htm
"I have been a huge fan of Jeep badge. The sturdy and macho vehicles that this American brand manufactures are simply unmatchable. I have been following the Jeep Compass since the time it was first showcased. The massive road presence and the sharp styling of the Compass SUV cannot be compared to any other crossover in the country. Apart from this, its tyres will get your heart racing, they are just fantastic.The crossover is fully loaded but the biggest surprise came in the form of the price. Just Rs 14.95 lakh! I am amazed with Jeep's pricing strategy, it undercuts almost all its rivals and is definitely here to rule the Indian automotive arena. The other plus points of the Compass is the availability in both the petrol and diesel engines. Another important bit of the Jeep SUV is the Jeep Active Drive 4x4 system which disconnects rear axle and effortlessly keeps on switching between 4x2 and 4x4 drive types to ensure one gets the 4x4 capability only when it's essential, thus saving the extra effort of the vehicle. I am sure it must be helping out on the fuel efficiency numbers as well. With the Compass, a new beast of performance is here. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will be watching how the sales of the Compass take off. However, the more critical aspect is how Jeep is able to tackle the after-sales service of the Compass in a country obsessed with 'cheap and best' philosophy."," Jul 31, 2017 ",By Micheal Verified Buyer,5,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-unbelievably-affordable-18366.htm
"After months of waiting fr it's launch, I booked the top-end 4x4 on the first day the bookings opened.
I am now going to cancel my booking. Reasons:
1. No delivery of 4x4 till Nov.
2. Imminent increase in taxes, & the On-Road Price will go frm 24 to 26 Lacs
3. Pay 26L fr a top-end vehicle, and you still have dummy buttons on the steering, undersized LCD with an odd plastic frame to cover the gap, & most importantly, NO SUN ROOF
4. 70000 diff between Limited & (O), All you get is a Black Roof & HIDJeep is making vehicles with Sun Roof, even the Trailhawk in Pune, but only for export. I can live without the Auto Wipers / Headlights / Cruise Control, but no Sunroof on a 26 Lac (mid-size) car.. doesn't work for me.
While the entry level Compass is priced right, the top-end is overpriced, considering Jeep is palming off an incomplete product to Indian customers."," Aug 23, 2017 ",By S Singh Verified Buyer,3,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/no-4x4-till-november-no-sunroof-18413.htm
"I saw the Jeep Compass at a nearby dealership today. It is smaller than what it looks in the images. The Tucson, in comparison, looks wider. Sit inside and the quality of the materials used is good. The space is also decent and two six-feet tall guys can sit one behind the other. But it doesn't look as wide as you think it will be. From the driver's seat, it feels as if you're sitting in a vehicle of Creta's size. After sitting in the Compressed, sorry Compass, I felt that the starting price of around Rs 15 lakh is fair, and not very aggressive. Also, considering the reliability issues with the brand in most other markets, even if you are saving some money upfront, it'll be used up on the SUV only, and may not count as savings. There were a lot of people out there to check the Compass in the dealership and it looks like it will sell in good numbers. But I think I'll wait to see how Jeep fares in the after-sales department. I'm not sure if they'll be able to manage it."," Aug 01, 2017 ",By Arun,2,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/small-suv-18369.htm
