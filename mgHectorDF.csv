"People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the mileage, Hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16kmpl. The dimensions of the car are humungous. In terms of comfort, the car can beat any of its rivals and is also prepared to compete with upper-class SUVs like Fortuner, Endeavour, etc. I recently went on a road trip in my hector and the ride quality was amazing, the suspensions were pretty soft providing a clean ride. Though the car is pretty huge, it is easily drivable in the city without any problem. I've heard it is also called the internet car due to the presence of a massive touch screen system with a pretty clear voice assistant. It manages to recognize the Indian accent as well. The pricing of the car is pretty neat and is the best car in the segment."," Nov 28, 2019 ",By Ritesh Gourav,2.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-machine-94866.htm

"Best and brilliant car by MG. If we compare the cars in Hector's price range Jeep compass is overprized, no premium features, and no comfort. Tata Harrier is fair and the interior is worst. The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying. I waited for mg was confused in hector and Creta but Hector was just better than Creta in terms of design, features, interior. So those people planning to buy hector buy the smart model because of it worth buying and I have also bought the smart one. Very Smooth SUV and with safety. A superior look with great Interior. When we talk about feature all upgrade and fully internet SUV."," Nov 27, 2019 ",By Gurmeet Balyan,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/best-and-brilliant-94678.htm
"Got a chance to drive this car. I didn't expect that the petrol hybrid engine gives this type of power. This engine is really awesome. The 1.5 ltr hybrid engine gives a lot of power in the mid-range up-to 2000 rpm some amount of lag is there but it pulls up pretty quick. The safety features of this car are very good, 6 airbags, Abs, EBD, TC, Hill hold etc. The design of this car is awesome and the comfort is very good. The rear passenger gets a rear armrest, rear Ac vents and a good amount of space. The main attraction of this car is the internet Inside 10.4-inch huge touch screen. It's really awesome. The sound quality is also great. Pros:- 1. Value for money 2. Fully loaded, the features in this price are like Panoramic sunroof, 10-inch touch screen with android auto and apple car play with 5G sim support, electrically adjustable driver seat etc 3. Safety. Cons:- 1. The Breaking is okay, not that great."," Nov 27, 2019 ",By Anonymous,4.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/this-british-suv-listens-to-you-and-talks-back-94659.htm

The car is good on cosmetics but I don't think that you can trust the engine for the long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to Indian road conditions. Giving a variety of features won't help if there is an issue in engine quality. The mileage is also very less and gives 7 KMPL on the highways.," Nov 24, 2019 ",By Chintan,2.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/ok-car-to-buy-94442.htm

"The length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. The 17-inch wheels also look a size too small. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention. The MG's cabin is simply cavernous and there is plenty of space for five passengers and their luggage. Range-topping versions get a massive panoramic sunroof that only adds to the airy feel in the interior. There are lots of other goodies onboard and the features really are a draw in their own right. The much talked about a 10.4-inch touchscreen that comes armed with connectivity tech is the focal point on the dashboard. Material quality is largely good but you will find some less special bits in the interior as well. The MG Hector Diesel is 170 HP, 2.0-liter engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, packs enough grunt and impresses with its linear power delivery and refinement. A snappy clutch remains a pain point of the Fiat-sourced engine though. The MG Hector Petrol gets a 143 HP, 1.5-liter turbocharged unit with a 6-speed manual as standard and a 48 V mild-hybrid setup as an option. The petrol hybrid is easy-going but lacks oomph for quick overtakes. The dual-clutch transmission does add convenience to the package but it's not the slickest of gearboxes. The ride quality is fairly good at town speeds, but up the pace, and you'll get a fair bit of body movement on undulating surfaces. The MG doesn't feel as well tied down as rivals at triple-digit speeds either and the noticeable body roll also means it simply isn't a driver's car. The steering isn't the most fearsome but it is light at low speeds and makes it easy to maneuver the large SUV."," Nov 20, 2019 ",By Brij Bhushan Katoch,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/it-is-a-very-cool-car-94123.htm

"I own a petrol hybrid MG Hector and the experience has been amazing to date. Have completed 2k kms. 1. The engine : sufficient power for this sized car. I initially thought the power to weight ratio would be evident when it comes to pulling the car, but I haven't experienced lack of power in most scenarios. The noise and vibrations are so low that sometime you wouldn't even know if the car is switched ON. 2. Driveability : light steering & clutch plus smooth gear transmission, it's an amazing combination to have especially if you drive a lot in the city. On the highway the steering doesn't feel very light, so you have sufficient control over the vehicle. Around the corners there definitely is the trademark SUV crossover bodyroll. If you are sitting in the rear seat, then you can be assured that you are sitting in the most comfortable space which you wouldn't get in any car. 3. Fuel efficiency: 6th gear and 80-120kms is the sweet spot for this car. Put it in this range and ull set records with the mileage. Mine clocks 19-21 km/L in this range. Within city under heavy traffic conditions I get 7-9km/L. 4. Infotainment system: a lot have complained on the sluggishness of the system, and even I felt the system to be slow. The latest update has fixed this issue. The system is smoother now. With a USB connected you can view photos and videos as well. 5. Space and overall comfort: the hector scores a 11/10 over here.. 10/ 10 with the sunroof closed and 11 with an open sunroof. Overall this is an awesome car in this segment and should be an obvious pick for anyone who is looking out to by am SUV crossover between 15 to 23Lakhs on-road price."," Oct 06, 2019 ",By Anonymous,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-car-88851.htm

On highway driving, the mileage of the MG Hector (Petrol) is 8.76 (tank full to tank full)! This is shocking. 2. Air-conditioning is very poor. At L1 (coolest) setting and at an ambient temperature of fewer than 35 degrees, it was uncomfortable inside the car. 3. The pick-up is very poor. Even on a small slope, and at low gear (2 or 3), the car struggles to move. 4. Many of the so-called ""high tech"" features do not work. On the plus side, the vehicle is spacious and four (not five) persons can sit comfortably.

"Hello, this is just a review after doing 4000 km on diesel top-end variant. I will not get into looks and interiors as so many people have written on it. I would just focus on my 4000 km travel experience. Did hill as well as national and state highway driving? Touched 170 km/h speed. Car is excellent to drive and braking at high-speed is fantastic. No vibration or sitting while breaking, just stops straight. On the bridge, joints do not jump or shake. Would rate it better than a Fortuner or Q5 which I have driven on some roads (Lucknow to Delhi). Hill driving did between Kanpur and shaktinagar. On hill, I find the car has less power especially when u change gears. The car has a perfect grip on hill turns. The car gave me an average fuel consumption of 18 between Kanpur and shaktinagar. Very comfortable seats just don't feel tired. Everything was perfect except for two issues. 1. headlights need improvement as on rainy night visibility gets bad. 2.

"MG Hector is one of the best SUVs in this segment. MG has basically competition with harrier and compass. I had driven this SUV so I am sharing my experience. Pros: 1. SUV has a good pickup. 2. Smooth drive.  Cons:1. Issue with the voice command. Either the voice command did not respond or it will listen to your personal talk too. 2. Display touch: Touch is not that much responding as expected. one can say that Touch is the same as in Chinese mobile. 3. cooling issue: Rear seat passenger is going to face this issue in Hot weather. Rear vent cooling is not as per the expectations. Due to the sunroof, rear seats have a much higher temperature. 4. The biggest issue which the one will face is the battery issue. Even MG knows that its battery is not that much perfect that's why MG is giving a 1-year warranty on the battery."," Jul 22, 2019 ",By Vikas Dixit,3.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/battery-issue-will-be-the-biggest-issue-73530.htm

"What's it like on the outside? The Hector is certainly a head-turner and it drew quite an audience everywhere and every time we stopped for photos on the picturesque route from Coimbatore to Coonoor. The nose has lots of interesting detailing and follows the current trend where the headlight cluster is placed down at bumper level with the LED DRLs sitting above where the lights typically should be. The humongous grille, which you just can?t miss, feels a touch oversized, even on a car so big though. The blade-like DRLs further accentuate the size of the grille and look great when illuminated. There's a good dose of chrome, of course, used liberally around the grille, and C-shaped headlight housings. The prominent air intake in the lower bumper and massive skid plate look the part and give the Hector serious SUV credibility."," Jul 02, 2019 ",By Annmay Kadve,5.0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-journey-ahead-69841.htm
